- 👋 Hi, I’m @Leif63
- 👀 I’m interested in lifelong learning and anything that can keep my brain activated
- 🌱 I’m currently picking up learning Python after not having touch programming for more than 4 decades. Back then I was struggling with COMAL 80 :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to embark on a steep learning curve starting with the basics and I do not have any specific projects on my mind.
- 📫 I can be reached at Leif.Mollebjerg@gmail.com
